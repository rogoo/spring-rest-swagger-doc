# OpenAPI and Swagger
Documentation of a REST spring API using OpenAPI 3.0. Remember OpenAPI is a specification and Swagger one tool that implements it.

The swagger can be accessed using this URL.
>http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

For the OpenAPI documentation go to this URL.
>http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs

You can change the OpenAPI endpoint using **springdoc.api-docs.path** in *application.properties*.

That is it folks!
